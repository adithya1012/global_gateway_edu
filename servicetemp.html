        <div class="info" >
        
        <p>Disclaimer: I received admits from USC, UBC, UIUC, Cornell, UCSD, Purdue, and NYU for Fall 2019.

        <p>The SOP is one of the most critical parts of your application because it helps the admissions committee know your personal interests and experiences. No other part of the application conveys this information to the committee. It can help you explain your sins and give reason that they will not be repeated. It can help you change a reject to an admit. It can also help you change an admit to an admit with funding. Given this importance, we want to ensure YOU get the best. For the same reason, our drafts are written by students who have already graduated from some of the top Ivy League universities.
        
        <p>A Statement of Purpose/Personal Statement can actually make or break your application. It is the ticket to your dream university if done right.</p>
        <p>All of the aforementioned points come under customizations. However, a completely new essay is not covered under customizations. Please note that customizations are different from modifications. Modifications in our service are free of charge.</p>
        
        <p>Please Note: We prefer drafting from scratch, but we will take your existing draft in consideration (if you already have one ready).</p>
        
        <p>This is going to change lives. The only question is, are you next? Good. Let's get you into your dream university!</p>
